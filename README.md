is_triangle is a function that takes three arguments a, b, and c, which represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function returns 1 if the three sides can form a triangle, and 0 otherwise. A triangle is formed if and only if the sum of the lengths of two sides is greater than the length of the third side for all possible combinations of sides.
